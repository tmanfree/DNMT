# Direct Network Management Tool (DNMT)

The Direct Network Management Tool *(DNMT)* is intended to house various functions that
require directly accessing switches through either SSH or SNMP.

DNMT can operate in direct or interactive mode. In direct, it will execute a 
single operation/function. In interactive mode it will show a prompt that displays
the various commands available. After using each command, the prompt will reappear.
 

Current functionality:

* **MAC Search** - *dnmt.py direct MACSearch IP MAC* . Based on the previous "Lefty" program, this is currently operational
in interactive or direct mode.
